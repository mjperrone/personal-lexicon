How many words do I actually know?

This is the question I want to answer, or at least get something close to that.
One relatively easy way to look for a lower bound on this is by looking at the
text that I have produced via my Facebook account. Fortunately, [Facebook lets
you download all your data](https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467/), so
I don't have to do something janky and parse this data off of their UI.

###Todo
1. parse Facebook photo comment data
1. parse gmail outbox
1. parse google hangouts
1. actually do some analysis with the parsed text...
