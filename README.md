How many words do I actually know?

This is the question I want to answer, or at least get something close to that.
One relatively easy way to look for a lower bound on this is by looking at the
text that I have produced digitally:

* [Facebook wall, chats, and photo comments](https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467/)
* [Gmail and google hangouts](https://www.google.com/settings/takeout)
* [Reddit](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/JSON) [comments](https://www.reddit.com/user/way_fairer/comments)
* [Twitter](https://blog.twitter.com/2012/your-twitter-archive)
* free text notes I've written


###Todo
1. Actually do some analysis with the parsed text...
1. Maybe add some other harder to parse sources like my papers in .doc  or .tex
   format
